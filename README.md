Chrome Extension for Time Tracking and Productivity Analytics

Overview
This Chrome Extension is designed to help users monitor their online habits by tracking the time spent on various websites and providing insightful productivity analytics. It classifies websites into productive and unproductive categories to offer meaningful feedback on your browsing behaviour. With a backend service for secure data storage and a user-friendly dashboard, the extension empowers users to improve their time management and productivity.

Key Features:
Automatic Time Tracking: The extension records the amount of time you spend on different websites during your browsing sessions.
Website Classification: Websites are categorised as productive (e.g., coding platforms, educational sites) or unproductive (e.g., social media, entertainment).
User Data Storage: All browsing and time data is securely stored on a backend server to enable long-term tracking.
Productivity Analytics Dashboard: Provides detailed reports and visualisations such as charts and summaries showing your weekly productivity.
Weekly Productivity Reports: Summarises your browsing activity each week, highlighting productive vs unproductive time.
Customisable Settings: Users can add or modify website classifications to better match their personal definition of productivity.

2. Data Transmission: The collected data is periodically sent to the backend server, where it is securely stored and processed.
3. Analytics: The backend analyses the data and updates the user’s productivity stats.
